This is a portal for seeking jobs for a single company(there can be many admins). The admins(employer) would upload job details using 'dash.php' after they log in and can edit their vacancy in 'jobman.php'.

The applicants(users) can see the job details without loging in, but can apply only after they have registered or logged in. Whenever an applicant applies to a job, he recieves an email confirming his application.

All the admins can view all the applications in their dashboards and can select or reject an applicant. Whenever an applicant is selected or rejected they recieve a mail informing them about it.
